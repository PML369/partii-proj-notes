Following flow of information, starting at ip_output and first working down the stack, then back up to top, then back down to ip_output:


netinet/ip_options.c L518 : ip_insertoptions may allocate a new mbuf in order to write into the packet header
netinet/ip_output.c  L1397: ip_mloopback takes a copy of a packet mbuf so that it can send it back up the stack
netinet/ip_output.c  L1399: ip_mloopback calls m_pullup, which may allocate a new mbuf on the front of the chain, resulting in 'copym' being changed.
net/if_loop.c		 L284 : if_simloop calls m_tag_delete_nonpersistent - TODO: decide if this packet should have the same id tag or a new one
net/if_loop.c		 L288 : if_simloop calls mac_ifnet_create_mbuf - TODO: Ask Graeme to confirm (if he can) that this isn't doing anything we want to know about
net/if_loop.c  L303 & 314 : if_simloop calls bpf_mtap. ASSUMING we consider BPF (Berkley packet filter) as a different subsystem, log this
net/if_loop.c		 L321 : if_simloop calls m_adj. This may free mbufs from the chain
net/if_loop.c		 L353 : if_simloop may free mbuf chain
net/if_loop.c		 L358 : if_simloop adds mbuf to the isr queue. This represents its transition into the input system
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1298 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) calls malloc for struct rtdetq (IP packet iformation - data, interface etc)
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1306 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) calls m_copypacket to (deep?) clone entire packet into mb0
kern/uipc_mbuf.c	 L506 : Aside: what's with this comment? It looks like it does a deep copy to me
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1342 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) calls malloc for struct mfc - multicast forwarding cache structure
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1347 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) calls m_copy to copy header
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1364 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) uses socket_send to send packet to V_ip_mrouter ("multicast routing daemon"?) [and frees an mbuf once it's done]
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1368 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) - lots of frees in this area on error
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1402 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) IP packet info (with mbuf pointer) submitted to queue awaiting mfc in this area
netinet/ip_mroute.c L1411 : X_ip_mforward (alias ip_mforward) - error related frees


NB: looks like NETISR_IP and NETISR_IP6 may be used to receive packets
